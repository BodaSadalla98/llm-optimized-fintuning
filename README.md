# llm-optimized-fintuning

In this project, we are exploring the potential of the new efficient fine-tuning
method QLoRA, for Large Language Models (LLMs). We fine-tune three open-source
models: LLama2-7b and Mistral-7b English and Jais-13b Arabic. The fine-tuning
task for English is story generation. The task for the Arabic model is poem
generation.
