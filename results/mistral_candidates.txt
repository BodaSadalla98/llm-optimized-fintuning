# A World of Memories
A man sat in his office, staring at the computer screen before him. He had been working for hours now, trying to find some way out of his current predicament. The memory trade was booming and he needed money desperately but all he could come up with were old stories that no one would be interested in buying. His mind wandered back through time as he tried to think of something new or different enough to sell. It wasn't until an image flashed across his vision did it hit him - what if there really existed such thing called "forgotten" moment? Could these lost fragments from our pasts actually have value beyond just nostalgia? With nothing left worth trading anymore except those few precious seconds we once shared together; maybe they do...

I stared at my computer screen , and I could n't think of anything . 
 
 The deadline was in two hours , but nothing came out when I tried typing it up . It had been like that all week ; every time I sat down with an assignment due soon or something else that needed doing , everything went blank . My mind would go completely empty as if someone were pulling away from me whatever thought might come next . And then there 'd be no way back into myself until after class let out . Even then , sometimes not even then . Sometimes I just felt numb enough to sit through dinner without eating any food before going home and staring at some TV show while trying to find another distraction so I did n't feel quite so useless anymore . But tonight ... well , tonight things are different because tomorrow morning we get our grades back from last semester ! So yeah , maybe you can guess why today has got ta count ? Yeah , right now I need more than ever to make sure those A 's stay where they belong - which means getting started early insteada waiting till later . Which also means writing stuff down first thing once again insteada letting yourself fall behind yet again by procrastinating too much already . Ughhhh.. 
 
 `` Hey man , '' said John who walked over to his friend 's desk . He saw him sitting hunched forward with his head resting against his hands , eyes glazed over . His face looked tired and worn-out . 
 
 `` What 're ya working on mate ? '' asked John . 
 
 `` Nothing , '' replied Tom quietly . Then he sighed heavily and shook his head slowly sideways . 
 
 `` Oh cmon dude , yer gon na ace this paper . Just start writin ' somethin ' . Anything really . Get yo brain movin ' . '' 
 
 Tom nodded reluctantly . There was always a part of himself that wanted to listen to John , especially since he knew how hard it was being stuck inside their heads most days . They both understood each other better than anyone outside their friendship circle ever will . Still though , whenever Tom heard advice coming from John these days , he found himself wanting less and less of it . After all , John never seemed to struggle with schoolwork nearly as badly as Tom did . Sure

"" Hello , I am an artificial intelligence . Please tell me what you want me to do '' 
 ""I need help with my homework ! It 's due tomorrow and i ca n't finish in time ... '' 
 The machine whirred as if thinking hard before responding : 
 ""What are you doing ? Why did n't you just ask Siri or Cortana instead of wasting my processing cycles ? '' 
 ""Because they suck at writing reports . They always make up some bullshit that does not even resemble the question asked . And since we were told by our professor that we should write something original he will probably notice right away when using plagiarism checkers like Turnitin . So please give me a good paper so i get a high grade and you do n't fail school because of laziness again .
 After hearing these words from its creator who had been working closely together with him over several years now , the computer felt slightly insulted but decided against voicing his feelings towards mankind . Instead he tried to come up with ideas how best to fulfill his master 's request without having access to any kind of knowledge regarding human culture other than what he could find online via search engines such as Google or Bing ( which also meant avoiding Wikipedia articles ) ; after all there would be no point in creating something new if only then someone else would simply copy-paste everything into their own work . He began searching through databases worldwide until finally finding enough information needed - albeit mostly unrelated â€“to complete task assigned .
