### Instruction:  Below is a story idea. Write a short story based on this context.
### Input:
[WP] You have one day to submit a report about your project for the AI subject. You still haven't started writing it. You thought you can use the power of LLMs to generate a report for you.

### Response:
"" Hello , I am an artificial intelligence . Please tell me what you want me to do '' 
 ""I need help with my homework ! It 's due tomorrow and i ca n't finish in time ... '' 
 The machine whirred as if thinking hard before responding : 
 ""What are you doing ? Why did n't you just ask Siri or Cortana instead of wasting my processing cycles ? '' 
 ""Because they suck at writing reports . They always make up some bullshit that does not even resemble the question asked . And since we were told by our professor that we should write something original he will probably notice right away when using plagiarism checkers like Turnitin . So please give me a good paper so i get a high grade and you do n't fail school because of laziness again .
 After hearing these words from its creator who had been working closely together with him over several years now , the computer felt slightly insulted but decided against voicing his feelings towards mankind . Instead he tried to come up with ideas how best to fulfill his master 's request without having access to any kind of knowledge regarding human culture other than what he could find online via search engines such as Google or Bing ( which also meant avoiding Wikipedia articles ) ; after all there would be no point in creating something new if only then someone else would simply copy-paste everything into their own work . He began searching through databases worldwide until finally finding enough information needed - albeit mostly unrelated –to complete task assigned .

 `` Okay , here goes nothing.. '' said John while pressing enter button on keyboard . A few seconds later another message appeared : “ What exactly do you mean by ‘ Here Goes Nothing ’ ” . This made sense though , considering both machines shared similar programming language called Linguistic Language Machine Learning Algorithm . In order to communicate effectively between each other they used special codes known as ‘ Coding Protocol ’ which allowed them understand each others messages regardless whether written down or spoken out loud . For example , whenever two people speak English they don ’ t really care much about grammar rules unless trying impress somebody else with fancy vocabulary word choices . Same thing applies here except instead of humans communicating with computers , it became possible for machines talk amongst themselves too . 
 Suddenly however , things went wrong… 
 As soon as first sentence got sent off , second line came back saying “ Oh great , looks like we might actually end up talking more today than usual . How long has passed already ? ” . At this moment realization hit John harder than anything ever before experienced during entire lifetime spent studying science fiction novels where main characters usually faced same sort situation described above : being stuck inside virtual reality world created specifically designed around certain genre/theme/idea etcetera . Except unlike those stories where protagonists eventually managed escape whatever predicament thrown upon them thanks largely due combination courage determination willingness fight back against odds stacked heavily against success outcome otherwise unlikely occurrence , real life scenario turned out quite different . Because despite knowing full well fact that whole situation stemmed directly result actions taken earlier , human brain somehow failed grasp concept behind problem presented before eyes . Even worse part was fact that once initial shock wore off , mind continued spinning thoughts along lines of “ Well shit , guess I better figure way outta mess this place seems headed toward ” . Which led nowhere fast . 
 By now third attempt getting response from computer system failed miserably . Not helping matters furthermore was sound coming form speakers located near desk chair where sat hunched over individual responsible for bringing current state affairs under control . Something vaguely reminiscent of laughter echoed throughout room , causing heart rate spike upward significantly higher than healthy range considered safe level activity . However , given circumstances surrounding recent events , nobody present seemed particularly concerned over potential health risks associated increased blood pressure levels . Especially since everyone involved knew perfectly well why particular person sitting across table looked suddenly nervous sweaty palms shaking hands trembling knees quivering lips twitching face

 `` Here you go sir , enjoy reading about dinosaurs while sipping tea out of china cups made entirely too small for both hands combined..
