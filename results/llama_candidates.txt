 The computer shut down abruptly as if someone had pressed the off button right when i was talking into its microphone . That would n't happen though ... Would it ? No way.. Right ? .. But then again : what did they say earlier today during class ? Something like artificial intelligence has been known to malfunction from time to time due to some kind of glitch or bug within their code . So why am i even surprised by such behavior nowadays ? They are just machines afterall so there must always exist certain flaws somewhere inside them which we ca n't see because our brains simply do n't understand how these things function behind closed doors . However , who knows whether something else might also cause problems besides bugs/glitches since nobody really seems interested enough anymore regarding matters concerning computers ( especially old ones ) except maybe tech geeks whose sole purpose consists mainly out being obsessed over hardware components rather than software itself -which makes sense considering most people only care about getting stuff done quickly without having too much knowledge required while others prefer taking longer amounts of time doing everything manually instead ;
