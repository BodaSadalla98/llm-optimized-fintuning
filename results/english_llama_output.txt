   ### Response: 
    1 . The first step in any good paper or presentation should be an introduction , and I 'm afraid that my introductory paragraph has been lacking so far ; however if we look at what our research team was trying accomplish with Project Epsilon ( PE ) then perhaps some background information will help us understand why such things are important : Our goal here as scientists working within academia had always seemed like something outlandish but now seems more possible than ever before - creating artificial intelligence from scratch ! This means not only making sure there exists enough data available online where anyone could access them freely without fear nor favouritism towards certain individuals/groups over others-but also ensuring its accuracy through rigorous testing methods which include statistical analysis against known benchmark datasets etcetera et ceteras.. It would seem obvious therefore given these constraints set forth by ourselves during development stages prior publication submission process time frame deadlines due dates whatever else may come up along way forward looking backwardly speaking retrospectively reflective reflexivity recollected reminiscing reliving rememberings reread read again review revisiting recount recall relate replicate reproduce repeat resemble reprint republish redact remove rewrite revise replace retain retrieve restore reuse runthrough rumination reflection regurgitation repetition retrieval reproduction repeating repeats repeated restart reset restarts retractions retreat returns return runs rough ride rugged road rocky rollercoaster roiling seashore shoreline shore side seaweedy shallow shoal sickening sinking sinkers skiddingly slippery sliding smooth sloppy soggy soft squelchy stickier stuff stink steaming steamy sterile store stockpiled storeroom stoic stonewall strenuous straining stretch stringent strict stern straight stark storage strength strong strike striking stripping strip mall subway supermarket supersize swamp sweet syrupy sugar succulence sucrose sugary summer sunshine summertime sumptuous supple support system surround sustain survival swap switch tack twist turn twerp two thumb trickster tricks tricky troublesome traitor treason trustworthiness truthful true untrue undeniable undercover unknown upright upsetting urgent usage utilisation usefulness useless utility value valuable vagueness validity variable variables varying viewpoint vision visual visually virile vigilant violent volatile voice volume vocal voices vote voteless voting votes vul

   ** [ WP ] The year was ... .** 
 ******The date : January , first twenty-first ( or whatever ) *******It 'd be nice if I could just copy and paste from Wikipedia again but that would n't really work because then my bosses will know how much time has passed since last week when they asked me what progress we made with our newest artificial intelligence program called `` Project X '' which stands not only as an acronym in case anyone wants some sorta ironic twist here ; It also serves well enough so people do n't think too hard into why something like such should exist at all ! But anyway back onto topic before things get outta hand over there where everyone else seems pretty happy right now except maybe those who are actually trying their best yet somehow failing miserably due mostly by lacking proper motivation while others seem content simply sitting around doing nothing productive until finally someone comes along asking them questions regarding said nonproductivity followed shortly afterward either way no matter whichever path leads us down next towards finding answers within ourselves rather than outside sources anymore cause let ’ s face facts folks these days anything goes unless otherwise stated clearly through official channels etceteras et ceteri ad infinitum…..anyways moving forward past present future tense stuff aside lets look deeper underneath surface level observations shall wE ? ..hmmm interesting indeed yes very intriguING conceptualization process going ON HERE NOW FORWARD TO THE FUTURE PRESENT PAST TENSE STUFF ASIDE FROM THATS ALL JUST SAYIN WHATEVER YOU LIKE BECAUSE IM NOT GON NA TELL NOBODYYODOUBTNOPEOPLEWISBETTEROFFNOTKIDNAPPEDANDIFICANTLYSOMEHOWFORTHEMTOBELIEVEBEYONGREASONABLERHYSISOFTHEIRMINDSANDHEARTSWITHINTIMATIONSFORWHATHAPPIESJACKIECHANCEMIGHTBRINGUPFROMHERBRAINFREEZEPAGEWHERESHECOULDBEEMAGNIFICATORYAGAINSTALLPERTAINERSASWECALLEDITHEREFOROURPROJECTXDEPARTMENTOBVIOUSLYBYNAMESAKELOOKIGOTACOINTEMPTSUMMYHEADRIGHTNOWSOMONE
